Basic Description: Here we work with jquery UI in addition to Javascript to implement a one-line Scrabble 
board game. This file includes the necessary elements for displaying the current word, total score, and
remaining tiles, a game board with slots for tile placement, a rack to hold the player's tiles, and 
buttons for game control. The scoreboard updates dynamically as the game progresses, ensuring players 
have real-time feedback on their performance.
